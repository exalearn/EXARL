class SYNC_ARS(exarl.ExaWorkflow):
    """
    This class implements a workflow by breaking the functionality into pieces.
    We define 3 key terms used throughout the implementation/documentation:

    Learner - the rank responsible for running the train/target train functions.
    Agents - the ranks responsible for training/inference.  Agents include learners.
    Actors - everyone that is not a learner.

    The following is an example useful for understanding the above descriptions.
    The example assumes 14 ranks (2 Learners, 5 Agents, 4 Environment)
    We present both the comms and the ranks.
    There is no actor comm so we add * to depict actors.
    Rank      0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13
    Learn     0  1  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -
    Agent     0  1  2  -  -  -  3  -  -  -  4  -  -  -
    Actor     -  -  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
    Envir     -  -  0  1  2  3  0  1  2  3  0  1  2  3

    For a single rank execution, global rank 0 is the learner, agent, and environment.

    The cut-off condition for this is based on how many episodes the
    done learner observes.  We have two sets of internal variables
    one set used by the learners and another used by the actors.
    Batches and weights are passed via the leaner and actor calls by
    setting self.batch and self.weights.

    We maintain a distinction between learner and agent variables even in the single
    rank such that this can serve as a base class for future workflows.  The actor
    and learner functions should remain unchanged.  The easiest changes should be
    made to the send/recv, init_learner, and run functions.

    TODO:
        - Add multi-learner - We can think if this should be in this class or in
        a inherited class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    block_size : int
        This is used to indicate we want on-policy learning
        and is used by the learner. When we want on-policy
        learning we set this to the total number of agents.
        We can allow off-policy learning by setting
        the value to one.  For sequential learning this
        is set to one.

    batch_frequency : int
        This value is used to determine how often we should
        send a batch of data.  The value represents performing
        batch_frequency steps per 1 batch send.

    next_episode : int
        This value is used by the learner to keep track of
        what the next episode to run is.

    done_episode : int
        This is a counter of how many episodes have been
        finished used by the learner.

    episode_per_rank : list
        This is a list of ints that indicate what episode
        each rank is working on. This is used by the learner.

    total_reward : int
        This is the sum of rewards for the current episode.
        This is used by an actor.

    steps : int
        This is the current step within an episode.
        This is used by the actor

    done : bool
        This flag indicates if the episode is done.
        This is used by the actor.

    model_count : int
        This is the current generation of the model.  This counter
        is set on the learner.  It is up to the send/recv to
        propagate this to the actors.

    save_weight_per_episode : bool
        This will cause the workflow to save the weights for each
        learner model generation.

    filename_prefix : string
        Prefix of the log file.

    train_file : file
        File we use to write logs to.

    train_writer : csv.writer
        Logger that writes to train_file.

    episode_reward_list : list
        This store total reward at the end of an episode.

    def learner(self, exalearner, nepisodes, start_rank):

        This function is performed by the learner.  The learner
        performs the following key steps:

        1. Receives batches of experiences
        2. Trains the models on the data received
        3. Checks if an episode has finished
        4. Sends data back to the appropriate actors

        Each call to train/target train represents a new model
        generation.  On-policy learning is means that the experiences
        contained by the batch are from the previous model (i.e.
        there is only one generation of models between them).
        Off-policy learning is done when experiences are used from
        previous model generations to train.  Training with a
        single actor will result in on-policy learning.  When we
        scale to use multiple actors we will by definition be
        training with older models.  If we were to collect data
        from each actor round robin with N actors, the model would
        be off policy by N models.

        The block_size variable is to approximate on-policy learning
        with multiple actors.  By setting block_size to the number of
        actors, we will only send a new identical model to all actors
        after we have received and processed data from each actor.

        The start_rank is used to indicate the first rank actor rank
        in the agent comm.  For sync learner this is rank 0 since
        the learner and actor are on the same rank.  For others this
        should correlate to the number of learners.

        In summary:

        For single-actor:
            start_rank = 0
            block_size = 1

        For multi-actor
            start_rank = number of learners
            For blocking (on-policy)
                block_size = size of agent_comm
            For non-blocking (off-policy)
                block_size = number of learners + 1

        Ideally this function should not have to be overloaded.

        This function is performed by actors.  It performs the follow:

        1. Receives model weights from the learner
        2. Set agents with new model weights
        3. Resets the environment if necessary
        4. Performs inference based on current state to get action
        5. Broadcasts that action to the other ranks in the env_comm
        6. Performs the action and determines the reward and next state
        7. Records the experience (i.e. states, action, and reward)
        8. Check for max number of steps and broadcast
        9. Updates the current state to the new state
        10. Sends batches of experiences to the learner

        We use the batch_frequency to determine how often we send
        results back the learner.  To send data only on a complete
