    This class implements vector clocks:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock
    https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/417/notes/logical-clocks.html
    Vector clock give us the ability to create partial orderings.
    We can use this to under stand what things are happening in parallel
    and this gives us a better view of how workflows are working.

    Vector clocks are implemented by having p counters (i.e. clock) on
    each process (i.e. rank).  P is the total number of processes (thus
    we have P^2 total clock across all ranks).  We increase our clock
    (i.e. clock[rank]) every event we encounter.  When we "send" a
    receive a message we update our vector of clocks to the max time
    (i.e. count) observed by each clock.

    When an event occurs and we increase our clock, we also record
    the event with a timestamp (i.e. the state of a rank's vector clock).
    At the end we can create a partial order by merging the records
    from every rank into one based on two key conditions:

    1. Two event happen at the same time if all of the clock are equal.
    2. Assuming two event have clocks that are not equal, an event a
    happens before event b if all of a's clocks are less than or equal
    to b's clocks

    To check for greater than we invert condition 2 and evaluate b vs a.
    If the events are neither = < >, then the events are happening
    "concurrently" (i.e. we have a partial order).

    This is not a complete DAG, as we are still developing the partial
    order based on the observed order of events.  In otherwords, events
    could be reordered from the point of view of execution reduce the
    number of dependencies.

    To create a complete view of the events across a run, we gather all
    the events from each node and stitch them together.  Since events
    are recorded in order on a single node, we do not need to perform
    a complete sort (rather we have just log(n) merging).

    Events are recorded via a decorator, which we attach to each function
    we care about.  Functions that can be seen as message sends, will
    call get_clock_to_send while messages that receive will call update_clocks.
